# TheBeatles
An arduino art project. It uses h-bridge DC motors to spin vinyls while it plays music. 

This is the second version of an art project I did in the past. It's a work in progress. The end goal will be four vinyls, cut in the shapes of beatles. They will be attached to DC motors controlled via an arduino board. The board will run all four motors (hopefully to the beat of the music). The board will also play preinstalled Beatles songs. The records willl be independent of the music but the music will not be able to play without the records spinning. The whole system will be controlled via wifi/bluetooth. 

This is a big transition from the original analog version of this art piece. However, I feel this upgrade is needed, as well as a new challenge to undertake.
